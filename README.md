Brands set up campaigns, allocate a budget, and share them through Solana Actions using Reclaim Protocol for Instagram verification and zkTLS proof to ensure privacy and security.

### 2. **User Participation**
Influencers connect their wallets via **Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter**, verify their Instagram account via Reclaim, and participate by posting stories that will generate real engagement.

### 3. **Engagement Proof**
Reclaim Protocol collects engagement data (e.g., Instagram views) and generates zkTLS proofs, ensuring that the engagement is real and verified.

### 4. **Payment Distribution**
Once engagement is verified, payments are processed through a secure escrow programs on Solana, ensuring influencers are rewarded fairly and without delay.
